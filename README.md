# üçå Banana Index

A fun and interactive web application that tracks banana prices and ripeness levels across different countries around the world! This project is specifically designed to demonstrate the powerful features of **Neon's MCP Server** with a modern web interface.

## About This Demo

This application showcases how Neon's MCP Server can be used to:

- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly connect to Neon's serverless Postgres database
- **Real-time Data Management**: Handle CRUD operations with automatic scaling
- **API Development**: Build RESTful APIs with Neon's robust backend capabilities
- **Modern Web Development**: Create responsive, interactive web applications
- **Production-Ready Features**: Demonstrate Neon's enterprise-grade database features

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Database**: Neon's MCP Server (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: In-memory (ready for Neon database integration)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients and animations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd banana-index
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Production

To run in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

## Database Integration

üìñ **For detailed database integration instructions, see [DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md](./DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md)**

This application is designed to integrate with Neon's serverless Postgres database using Drizzle ORM. The integration includes:

- **Drizzle Schema**: Type-safe database schema definition
- **Database Configuration**: Neon connection setup
- **Migration Management**: Safe schema changes and data migration
- **Query Optimization**: Performance monitoring and optimization tools

## API Endpoints

The application provides a RESTful API for managing banana data:

- `GET /api/bananas` - Get all countries in the index
- `POST /api/bananas` - Add a new country to the index
- `GET /api/bananas/:id` - Get a specific country by ID
- `PUT /api/bananas/:id` - Update a country's data
- `DELETE /api/bananas/:id` - Remove a country from the index

### Example API Usage

```bash
# Get all bananas
curl http://localhost:3000/api/bananas

# Add a new country
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bananas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "country": "Japan",
    "pricePerKg": 2.50,
    "averageRipeness": 8.5,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'
```

## Fun Facts

- üçå Bananas are the world's most popular fruit
- üåç Over 100 billion bananas are consumed annually
- üìà The global banana market is worth over $25 billion
- üö¢ Most bananas travel thousands of miles to reach consumers
